// NOTE: Main mem (near+far) should consist of 335*1024 bytes
// (for Keen Dreams with EGA graphics)

// Based on tests with Catacomb Abyss (even if not precise), targetting...
// - 3408 bytes returned by coreleft (before manually removing/ignoring a gap between near and far memory in the game's memory manager).
// - 448592 returned by farcoreleft.

// Previously, there were also 0 EMS bytes and 65520 XMS bytes ranges in use, but
// these were disabled in be_cross_mem.c (they don't have to be enabled, technically).
//
// Furthermore, after moving a few embedded chunks (mostly TEXTSCN.SCN) to the
// memory managed *here* (rather than using native malloc function separately),
// we had to increased available (far) memory.
