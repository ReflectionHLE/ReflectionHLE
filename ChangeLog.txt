Aug 24, 2021 (v0.33.1):
* Identified as "Loud Edition" in-game, since changes related to audio mixing
increased the default sound volumes, at least outside of the PC Speaker.
* Nuked OPL3 is now at git revision bb5c8d08a85779c42b75c79d7b84f365a1b93b66.
* Introduce slider UI for a few launcher settings.
* Add a new Sound Blaster emulation option, currently relevant just for Wolf3D.
Use SB for mono output, and SB Pro or SB 16 for stereo panning of
digitized sounds. Note that it's more significant after choosing SB 16.
* Volumes for SB stereo panning, and internally also for OPL emulation
with relation to the SB Pro/16, are based on tables of dB values
posted here by James-F: https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=54269
* Add user-accessible per-device volume controls, independent of what was
described earlier (e.g., Wolf3D's stereo panning). Note that these volumes
are configurable per-device.
* In particular, you cannot separate the OPL (AdLib) volumes
of music and sound effects in Catacomb 3-D or Wolfenstein 3D.
* Also, before playing Keen Dreams using the data from the 2015 port,
you should use the digitized sound volume slider. Reason is that
the sound effects were re-recorded into digitized forms.
* Balance the default PC Speaker volume, following the changes.
* Fix a sound mixing bug. Previously, the more sound sources were added to
the mixer, the quieter each of them would be in the mixed output. Instead
of taking the average of the sources, take the sum and clamp the result.
* Other miscellaneous changes.

Aug 2, 2021 (v0.33.0):

* Additional restructurings of game-agnostic code.
* Nuked OPL3 is updated to the last revision.
* Keen Dreams: Try to fix memory allocation problems
while using the data from the 2015 port.
* Keen Dreams, 3D Catacombs: For an uncached map, if the map header offset
being read is nonnegative but smaller than 8, just quit with an appropriate
error message. This fixes behaviors which greatly depend on the memory layout,
including a possible hang.
* Catacomb Abyss: Make it possible to warp to map 19, at least in general.
Also fix crashes upon attempts to load map 20 or 21 by
outputting a new error message.
* 3D Catacombs, Wolfenstein 3D: Add a "novert" toggle, letting the user
limit in-game mouse movements for turning/moving left and right.
* Wolfenstein 3D: Add a "lowfps" toggle, used for explicitly lowering the
frame rate. The purpose of this is controlling, to an extent, how far can
pushwalls move. Reason is, they were intended to move for 2 tiles, but
it turned out that they could move for 3 tiles as computers were
becoming faster. The Fake Hitler's fireballs also turned out
to move slower while the frame rate was higher.
* Wolfenstein 3D: Emulate, to an extent, the consequences of a
buffer overflow that follows a press on a pushwall while it's moving.
This is basically a Vanilla Bug, in which such walls are operated as if
they were doors, and unintentional changes to static objects may occur.
* Wolfenstein 3D: Upon trying to load a non-existent level
(say, in the March 1992 prototype), just report that the map isn't 64*64.
This is mostly similar to the outputs of the original executables,
while skipping potential undefined behaviors.
* Wolfenstein 3D: Fix menu navigation with the mouse while using a window.
* Change the way controller buttons get mapped under
the modern controller scheme. Basically, rather than parsing
the game's own configuration of keys and then using it as a base
for the mappings, just use the game's default bindings internally.
For instance, if a button was previously configured to be mapped
to "Jump" in Keen Dreams, it'll now map to the Ctrl key instead.
* Note that such buttons may internally get mapped to mouse buttons
instead of keyboard keys, in case "Motion emulation mode" is set to
"Mouse". The behaviors should remain unmodified in such a case.
* Further note that the above-mentioned changes impact
touch input, albeit the UI remains as-is.
* Amend controller usability fix from v0.32.1 to work better
when the setting "Motion Emulation Mode" is set to "Mouse".
* Add REFKEEN-NOTES.txt files to the source tree, describing technical changes
from the original versions of games, including cases in which such changes
exist for the purpose of emulating vanilla bugs. The information was
collected by looking for mentions of the word REFKEEN in the sources.
* Other miscellaneous fixes.

Jun 6, 2021 (v0.32.1):

* Redistributable application bundles can now be built for macOS with CMake.
(Thanks to Blzut3 for this addition.)
* Fix a possible crash, reproduced while binding an in-game action
to a controller button in the launcher with SDL 2.0.14 (thanks chungy).
This was a side-effect of an increase of SDL_CONTROLLER_BUTTON_MAX's value.
* More generally, mentions of enumerated controller buttons and axes
from SDL2 were replaced with equivalents defined in be_st.h. A few
related range checks were further added.
* The Xbox Elite controller's paddles can now be used as an additional
alternative to buttons, in case SDL 2.0.14 or compatible is used.
* Fix a significant usability problem with game controllers. When an
axis' value changes sign, a proper "release" notification should now
be sent for the original sign. Previously, the user could unexpectedly
get stuck in a specific state, like a continuously rotating protagonist.

Dec 25, 2020 (v0.32.0):

* KDreams, Catacombs (and Wolf3D): Make it possible
to bind actions to a game controller's D-pad.
* Wolf3D: Support game controllers, in a similar manner to
what's already been covered for Keen Dreams and the Catacombs.
Further add mappings for touch input.
* Wolf3D: Support stereo panning. This might not be fully accurate,
but hopefully, it's not that far.
* Wolf3D: Support saved games. They should be read and written using the same
formats as the original DOS versions. This may currently be buggy by nature.
* SD_TimeCountWaitFromSrc/SD_TimeCountWaitForDest timing fix, applying to
all games, but especially noticeable while playing back demos in Wolf3D.
* Add support for Spear of Destiny FormGen version 1.0, as well as the
variation of FormGen version 1.4 which is actually identified as "V1.4"
in-game. Currently, the one mistakenly identified as "V1.0" won't be detected.
The mission packs' data still needs to be the same as in the
Activision version, thus e.g., including the UAC logs.
* When game installations are shown in the launcher, don't print their
locations for now. This might become more useful later, in case it will
be possible to choose any of multiple game installations which otherwise
match the same version (e.g., due to somewhat differing game data).
It shouldn't matter as much for now.
* A change that may potentially break saved games made
with older versions of the KDreams and Catacombs ports:
The macros COMPAT_OBJ_CONVERT_OBJ_PTR_TO_DOS_PTR and
COMPAT_OBJ_CONVERT_DOS_PTR_TO_OBJ_PTR were fixed. The original sizes
of the object structs, as present in the DOS executables from the 90s,
are now used, instead of sizeof(objtype) from the source ports.
* Other misc. fixes and modifications. Thanks to Blzut3 for
assistance with a subset of the changes in this version.

Oct 16, 2020 (v0.31.0):

* Support more than one possible filename for game data and EXE names.
Following this, a file named "NOAH3D.EXE" can now be identified as
a part of Super 3-D Noah's Ark, in addition to "NOAH3DOS.EXE".
This refers just to the matching DOS executable.
File integrity check is done using the size and crc32.
* Additionally, again thanks to the above, support for the
Spear of Destiny Mission Packs is now in. Reason it's related
is that the file extension of the mission-specific game data can vary,
depending on the game installation being in use and its current state.
For all missions (including the original), .SOD and .SD4 are valid
file extensions. Other allowed extensions: .SD1 for the base game,
.SD2 for mission 2 and .SD3 for mission 3.
* Note that as a side-effect, data integrity checks are now done for all
game data (graphics, maps, sounds) read from the Wolfenstein 3D codebase.
In addition to earlier uses of it, the hidden "manualgamevergame" setting
can now be used to disable this, albeit this might make it impossible
to properly start Super 3-D Noah's Ark or any of the Spear of Destiny
missions, depending on the filenames.
* Add support for more versions of Wolfenstein 3D, again by using code from
gamesrc-ver-recreation. This covers Apogee 6-episodes versions 1.1, 1.2 and
1.4, two GT Interactive releases, an id Software release, Apogee 3-episodes
versions 1.2 and 1.4, an Imagineer version and the March '92 prototype.
(Thanks to the wolf3denginepatches repository and Chris for assistance.)
* Add detection of Wolfenstein 3D as it used to be offered via the
last incarnation of 3drealms.com, either on its own or as a part
of the 3D Realms Anthology. (Thanks Lunick.)
* Add detection of Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny and Super 3-D Noah's Ark
as currently available from GOG.com. (Thanks WayneCa and chungy.)
* Improve detection of game installations which is done by inspecting
the Windows Registry. Basically, this is now done by attempting to
inspect data for 32-bit and 64-bit applications altogether, while
additionally still trying to get data with SHGetValue as usual.
* Wolf3D: The UPLOAD macro was replaced with an UPLOAD variable.
* Internally rename the wl1ap12 namespace to wl6ap11, and do the same with
other mentions of such strings. Most noticeable impact is probably
that when separate Wolf3D EXEs are build, reflection-wl6ap11 is
created instead of reflection-wl6ap12.
* Typo fix: Do show "Wolfenstein 3D Shareware v1.4 (Local)" when referring
to shareware v1.4, instead of mistakenly mentioning v1.2 in the string.
* Use a bit shorter descriptions for certain Wolfenstein 3D and
Spear of Destiny versions, so they can fit as launcher titles
(BE_Launcher_Handler_SupportedGameVersionSelection).
* Add high level XMS and EMS implementations, use them in Wolf3D's
Page Manager, and also remove the REFKEEN_SIMPLIFIED/NOEMS/NOXMS
implementations from Wolf3D. (Thanks Blzut3.)
* Wolf3D: Following the removal of the REFKEEN_SIMPLIFIED-specific code
from id_pm.c, pointers can now be appropriately converted in ShapeTest.
* A small fix for using page up/down in the launcher while
none of the menu items can be selected.
* A couple of fixes for bugs introduced after the audio mixer refactoring,
specific to runs without the audio subsystem.
* Separate more audio and timing related code into more files, while reducing
direct references to SDL (albeit it's still used in the same manner).
* Generally, continue splitting the contents of be_cross_fs.c and
making other restructurings and differing changes related to this code.
* Wolf3D: Fix a possible buffer overflow in US_CheckParm, reproduced by
passing an argument with no alphabetical character. A good example is
the second argument in the following arguments string: "-tedlevel 1".
* Make the codebase more usable with Visual Studio.
* Launcher: Add a missing comment about the impact of the
scale type setting on the border porches.
* Bug fix: Conditionally hide or show the mouse cursor after
toggling fullscreen, depending on game-specific setups.
* Fix an instance in which the in-game contents don't get
appropriately resized after toggling fullscreen.
* Wolf3D: Make the mouse cursor usable while the game
is paused, if a fullscreen isn't used.
* Other misc. fixes/changes.

Sep 28, 2020 (v0.30.1):

* Don't show controller settings specific to the Catacombs for Wolf3D.
* When letting the user choose a root drive on Windows for locating
game data, append a backslash. For instance, use "C:\" instead of "C:".
Otherwise, the wrong locations may get accessed with _topendir.
* Fix dir resource leak in BEL_Cross_DirSelection_PrepareDirsAndGetNames.
* Wolf3D: Fix the occurrence of a stale menu item in the
main menu for the GOODTIMES and SPEAR versions.
* Improve the scrolling in the launcher a little bit,
mostly while pressing on up/down.

Sep 26, 2020 (v0.30.0):

* 6-years anniversary release.
* Initial support for Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny
(minus the mission packs) and Super 3-D Noah's Ark (DOS version).
For Wolfenstein 3D, this covers all known shareware Apogee versions
which allow cheating, as well as 6-episodes Activision version 1.4.
For Spear of Destiny, this covers FormGen demo version 1.0 and
Activision version 1.4. For Super 3-D Noah's Ark, this covers
the one known version.
* Note that for technical reasons, the Spear of Destiny mission packs
cannot be loaded as-is.
* Additionally, Super 3-D Noah's Ark can only be loaded if the original
EXE for DOS is found and named "noah3dos.exe". That's because this is
the way it's currently offered from Steam, and right now, there's no
good way of supporting detection of the same data with another file name.
* Currently unsupported in all games from the modified Wolfenstein 3D codebase:
Game saving/loading, modern game controller scheme, probably more.
* The rate of palette updates in Wolfenstein 3D is at least somewhat imprecise.
* VSync was changed to be disabled by default for now. There are other
potential problems with timing in Wolfenstein 3D, which might partially
be related to instances in which the game tries to render more often
than the host display's refresh rate.
* It is now possible to make a single exe that can be used for starting any
of the supported Catacomb titles. It is identified as "Reflection Catacomb".
This requires building the code as C++, since it makes use of namespacing.
* The exact same method can be used for building a single exe covering
all currently supported versions of Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny
and Super 3-D Noah's Ark. This exe is identified
as "Reflection Wolfenstein 3D".
* Template instantiations of reads and writes are now done
from the game-specific code, so be_cross_fs.c doesn't need
to include kd_def.h/c3_def.h/def.h.
* Game definition structs were moved to separate headers.
* 256-colors VGA graphics can now be drawn for Wolfenstein 3D.
This was done with a subset of the existing EGA drawing routines as a base.
* The overscan border is now shown only if aspect correction is toggled on.
An original goal of the aspect correction toggle was to make the source ports
more usable with displays that have a greater risk of screen burn-in.
* Refactor the audio mixing code, so PC Speaker, AdLib / OPL and
digitized sounds can be concurrently played back in Wolfenstein 3D.
There's now a single audio mixer callback which can obtain data
from multiple sound sources, resample the inputs to the output
sampling rate and then mix them after resampling.
* Use a pre-calculated sintable array for the Catacombs, as well as
Wolfenstein 3D. It is present in a newly added fixed_sintable.c file.
This fixes possible rendering errors, as well as errors related to gameplay.
The source of the problem (as checked with one of the Catacombs)
was that sintable[90] could be set to 0x10000, while it was
rather set to 0xFFFF with the original executables.
* Switch to Nuked OPL3 for OPL emulation.
* Make it possible to toggle fullscreen via a key combo. This combo should
generally be Alt+Enter. While untested, Command+Enter should be used on macOS.
* Revert to updating ticks (e.g., the games' TimeCount variables) from the
main thread instead of the SDL audio callback thread, albeit with the
code in general still being closer to the later revisions.
* Migrate to CMake for building the executables.
* Other varying fixes and modifications.

Jan 25, 2019 (v0.18.3):

* This is a maintenance release mostly intended for Android users, although
there are also a few changes which aren't Android-specific.
* Fixed a bug where the wrong Catalog / Hint Book EXE would be shown
in the launcher.
* Further fixed a bug where, for game controller or touchscreen users,
the 'P' key would mistakenly appear in one of the on-screen buttons
for the hint book in Catacomb Armageddon/Apocalypse. It'd also be
usable for no good reason.
* Hopefully fix in-game timing after resume from a pause on Android.
* The Android build files have been updated (twice) from SDL2's repo.
Unfortunately, the minimum supported Android version has been raised
to 4.1 (i.e., API level 16).
* Additionally, the original armeabi ABI (not to be confused with armeabi-v7a)
is not supported anymore.
* On the other hand, 64-bit Android binaries (arm64-v8a and x86_64)
are now built, as currently configured.
* Using a recent SDL2 Mercurial update, an OpenSL ES sound driver is
now used on Android by default. While your mileage may vary as usual,
hopefully this will resolve the great issue of high audible latency.
* Added circular icons for Android. Also added banners, in case you want to
try and run any of the games on Android TV. Your mileage may vary, though!
* Allow the sound sample rate to internally change from the user's choice.
For EXEs built with SDL 2.0.9 headers or compatible, the same also applies
to an internal samples field (a part of SDL_AudioSpec).
* The default value of sndInterThreadBufferRatio was changed from 8 to 2. It
turned out that 8 was simply too high, at least in a specific setup with the
2015 Keen Dreams edition. It's probably also less assisting for Android,
either way, especially after the migration to OpenSL ES.
* Reflection Keen should now search for game data from Steam in
the lowercase "steamapps" directory, in addition to "SteamApps"
(mostly relevant for Linux users).
* Other few misc. fixes.

Aug 14, 2017 (v0.18.0):

* Move some memory management code from the differing id_mm.c files to a
separate be_cross_mem.c file. For the sake of simplicity, XMS and EMS are
gone. This newly added source file also grants us some more control over
memory management, using functions like BE_Cross_Bfarmalloc as replacements
for functions originally used in the DOS sources (such as farmalloc).
* Somewhat better support for multi-EXE emulation, like CATABYSS.EXE
and INTRO.EXE for The Catacomb Abyss v1.13. This includes a replacement
for the execv function, reverting the state of the runtime stack.
This is mostly useful when two DOS EXEs may execute each other, over and
over again (e.g., INTRO.EXE and DEMOCAT.EXE from The Catacomb Abyss v1.13).
* Minor loadscn changes (mostly renames).
* An almost complete port of DEMOCAT.EXE/HINTCAT.EXE is now in. It's still
impossible to send anything to a printer, but otherwise it should have
similar behaviors (albeit the sound beep periods may be shorter).
As a side-note, this makes the 'F10' key usable in
the intro, with The Catacomb Abyss v1.13.
* Minor related fixes in be_st_sdl_audio_timer.c and be_st_sdl_graphics.c,
as well as small changes for alt. controller mappings handling.
* Also fix parsing of filenames from e.g., SCRIPT.HNT, The Catacomb Armageddon
(for instance, "HINT01.HNT " should first be trimmed to "HINT01.HNT").
* For the later Catacombs titles, it's now possible to choose between
the game and HINTCAT.EXE/DEMOCAT.EXE, right from the launcher. The last
choice is saved for the next time Reflection Keen is started. There's
further the addition of the related /slidecat command-line argument.
* More changes for game versions management - We now store a separate list
of "main functions" for each game version. Usually, they have matching
EXE filenames (Keen Dreams 2015 is an exception).
* When Reflection Keen checks for an available game installation, all it does
is check for recognized game data (and EXE) files. It does not, at this point,
look for embedded data, like INTROSCN.SCN in CAT3D.EXE. It also does not
unpack any packed EXE. This may only happen when the game (or slidecat)
is started, *or* when BE_Cross_Bexecv is called.
* In particular, embedded data like INTROSCN.SCN is *not* written as
an external file anymore. It's also impossible to use replacements for
these with "manualgamevermode=true".
* Ensure last display number. is saved, regardless of any specific event.
* On an attempt to resolve the issue of high audio latency leading to a low
framerate (reproduced on Android), we now basically run the various sound
callbacks (originally SDL callbacks) in the main thread. This is done in
virtually the same way as if the sound system were disabled, only that
an additional buffer is used for passing samples to the SDL audio thread.
* The new "sndinterthreadbufferratio" setting can be used to adjust this
buffer's size, as well as the sizes of internal PC and AL buffers.
They're calculated relatively to the buffer size chosen for
the SDL callback thread (used only in this callback).
* Other misc. fixes.

Apr 01, 2017 (v0.17.0):

* A POSSIBLE REGRESSION: An unexpectedly low(er) framerate may be reproduced
on Android, at least in the Catacombs.
* ANOTHER WARNING: If the classic controller scheme is in use, then
re-calibration may be required. This is the case due to a few internal changes,
with one of them fixing a possible division by zero error. The latter could
be reproduced in Keen Dreams v1.00, for which support is now in (see below).
* Not well-tested: Launcher window is now positioned in the same display as
the in-game window, in multi-display setups. Also, there's a new setting,
which tells if the last display is saved for later runs.
It's toggled on by default.
* -cfgdir related bug fix, timing fixes and other misc. fixes.
* If you don't mind building your own binaries from the sources,
then compatibility with OS X/macOS is now in (thanks rhoenie and Dominus).
Note that this isn't well-tested, due to the lack of direct access to a Mac.
* Added support for Keen Dreams v1.00. Internally, this includes the
ability to read data from KDREAMS.EXE as originally released, being
packed with PKLITE v1.05. Doing this is now possible thanks to depklite,
which is more-or-less a port from C++11 to C99 of OpenTESArena's ExeUnpacker.
* Known issue: Warping to a non-existant level in Keen Dreams v1.00
(e.g., level 6) may, essentially, lead to undefined behaviors.
* Added partial support for the Keen Dreams 2015 re-release
(Steam, IndieGameStand). Note that this support is essentially a bonus, and
it's still recommended to use the data from a supported DOS version. A great
deal of updates were for sound playback support, but there's more than that.
* Also, as of this release of Reflection Keen, this will *not* work with
the 2015 re-release as downloaded from Steam on Windows, due to minor
differences in GAMETEXT.KDR. These are a couple of text bugs, that should
be corrected if the game is downloaded using the Linux (or Mac) client,
but they haven't been carried over to Windows so far.
* Further note that kdreams.cfg is updated after manually closing the
game window, *only* if the 2015 data is used.
* Compatibility with saved games from the 2015 re-release is more-or-less
present, while compatibility with kdreams.cfg is only partial. So, watch out.
* A few misc. 2015 specific features were implemented, e.g., a bug fix
resetting the amount of keys when a new game is started. This does *not*
necessarily cover all behaviors of the 2015 release, though. Also, as expected,
2015 specific features are *not* in effect when a DOS version's data is in use.
* Support for joysticks / game controllers with the 2015 data is
the same as with the DOS versions' data.
* Mouse support is also the same, although it's possible to pass the
2015-specific command-line argument of /SWMOUSE to temporarily disable
the "Absolute mouse motion" toggle. Note that the /NOASPECT and /WINDOWED
arguments described in GAMETEXT.KDR didn't seem to work in the
2015 port itself (using an EXE from May 9 2016 or earlier),
so these are not implemented here, either.

Oct 12, 2016 (v0.16.0):

- BREAKING CHANGE: The file HELP.TXT is now required in order to
play The Catacomb Abyss.
- Regarding The Catacomb Abyss v1.13, the expected/extracted EGAHEAD.ABS and
MTEMP.TMP files should be a little bit smaller. Previously, whole segments
would be extracted from the CATABYSS.EXE file, leading to a little
bit larger files (with filesizes divisible by 16 bytes).
- Added support for multi-touch input, along with an Android port;
Currently requires Android 2.3.3 (API level 10) or later and targets 7.0 (24).
- Some "modern" game controller input adjustments, including changes to the
handling of debug keys.
- Some launcher adjustments; Examples: The ability to set (emulated)
command-line arguments for the game, showing/hiding an on-screen keyboard for
text search/input, access to details about files from supported game versions.
- "autolock" setting was replaced with the "mousegrab" setting, which
behaves somewhat more (but not exactly) like the mouse grab setting
from Chocolate Doom.
- Added a "absmousemotion" setting, optionally letting one seamlessly move
the mouse cursor out of the window in Keen Dreams' control panel. This is
disabled by default, since it technically behaves a bit differently
from vanilla Keen Dreams.
- If multi-touch input is used, and the /NOMOUSE option is *not* passed
to Keen Dreams, then the mouse cursor in the control panel can be used
with a single finger, in a matter similar to enabling "absmousemotion" for
an actual mouse. That is, the ship cursor (more precisely, its top-left corner)
is shown where the finger resides.
- Big Endian fixes (including fixed sound support).
- Misc. graphics output optimizations. This includes changes to emulated EGA
memory layout; Using one byte per pixel, rather than four monochromatic
sections for the four EGA planes. Reason is this is better for the Catacombs,
and it also didn't seem to make things worse for Keen Dreams.
- Screen is refreshed more often, even if there's no actual on-screen update.
This is done for somewhat better Steam Overlay support and other situations.
- Minor DBOPL fixes.
- Support better resampling of audio (from the OPL rate of 49716Hz to a
different rate), using a resampling library. Currently SpeexDSP is used.
- Fix some unaligned memory accesses, as well as a few buffer overflows.
- Fix duplicated game controllers on startup, in launcher.
- Other code modifications.

Nov 20, 2015 (v0.13.0):

- A minor breaking change: The disablesndsubsystem setting was changed to
sndsubsystem, for avoiding double negatives and being more consistent with
newly added code (the launcher).
- A new launcher is now in. By default, it is shown before starting any game,
but command line arguments can be used to skip it. It is now the way to
configure the Reflection Keen ports as an alternative to manually
editing cfg files. This may be mostly useful for configuring
game controllers with the modern controller scheme, but not only.
- Reflection Keen may detect and use existing game installations from more
than one location: Current working directory, GOG.com installation of
the Catacombs for windows, or a directory manually selected from the launcher.
There are also checksum and filesize validations for game data.
- Embedded resources like MAPHEAD.KDR are now written externally. They can
be extracted from original DOS executables automatically and then used by
Reflection Keen. However, the games still behave as if these resources
were linked into the EXEs. For each game, they're loaded to memory
by Reflection Keen before entering the game's main function.
- Some Reflection Keen EXEs unifications were made. To summarize,
there's now a single EXE per game, possibly supporting
multiple original versions of the game.
- Due to the above change, new files are now written to separate directories,
based on the game version.
- The EXE filenames are also longer, just to reduce the chances of weird
conflicts. Names without file extension: reflection-kdreams, reflection-cat3d,
reflection-catabyss, reflection-catarm and reflection-catapoc.
- The cfg files were renamed in a similar manner (for the sake of consistency).
This may technically look like a breaking change on its own, only the cfg files
and more should be relocated to different directories anyway.
- Files can be accessed by filenames in a case insensitive-manner.
Case sensitivity still applies to folder names, though!
- By default, the Reflection Keen cfg files are now written to a specific
directory depending on the current user. It may be overridden using the -cfgdir
command-line argument. For instance, on Linux, the default location is
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/reflection-keen, if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is defined
and filled, or ~/.config/reflection-keen otherwise.
- Reflection Keen looks for gamecontrollerdb.txt in the same place where
the cfg files are stored.
- Other files are similarly written to a possible different directory depending
on the current user, by default. -datadir can be specified
to override this. For another Linux example, the default location
is $XDG_DATA_HOME/reflection-keen or ~/.local/share/reflection-keen.
- Improvements were made to the modern game controller scheme. The ability to
configure it from the newly added launcher is one thing, but there's more. Some
of these may be a bit too technical, but a clear example may be the ability
to show an on-screen keyboard for entering debug keys (e.g., cheat codes).
- As a consequence, the modern game controller scheme is now the default.
- Changes were made to "key repeat/delay" behaviors. These are now done in
software (using SDL_GetTicks for timing), and should be similar while using a
game controller in the launcher. This is also the case while using a controller
in-game with the modern controller scheme, as long as keyboard key presses
are emulated internally, or an on-screen keyboard is in use.
- While a bit technical, BE_SDL* functions were renamed BE_ST*, emphasizing
the fact they may contain platform/framework specific code, but it doesn't have
to be SDL (e.g., in case there's no available port of SDL on some platform).
Filenames were similarly renamed, so there are now be_st.h,
be_st_sdl.h and be_st_sdl*.c.
- More fixes and other changes.

Mar 13, 2015 (v0.10.0):

- After some time of not having one title covering the whole codebase,
"Reflection Keen" is finally in use.
- Experimental support for alternative controller schemes is implemented. This
should theoretically make it more comfortable to use game controllers with the
Xbox 360 Controller layout. Taking advantage of the SDL_GameController API,
a mapping table is used so this is theoretically not limited just to XInput
controllers. This is currently disabled by default, though, and at
least one edit to the generated cfg file is expected. Furthermore,
as a side-effect SDL 2.0.2+ is known to be required now.
- Alright, it's probably better to consider this unofficial, but there is now
partially-tested support for big-endian architectures (or bi-endian archs in
big-endian modes). It's a bit difficult to test this with the lack of
appropriate hardware, though (in particular audio support is totally untested).
In addition, commonly used architectures of these days (x86, x86-64, ARM)
generally operate in little-endian modes. So, again, better assume that
big-endian modes aren't officially supported.
- It should be possible to disable the sound subsystem by enabling
the "disablesndsubsystem" setting in the generated cfg file. The code
changes also include a fix for an infinite loop in SD_WaitSoundDone
in case the sound subsystem is disabled. Furthermore, in such a case
a silent PC Speaker is emulated, but the OPL emulator isn't running.
- Code can optionally be built as C++ now, using g++ version 4:4.8.2-1ubuntu6
(should be based on v4.8.2). It is still built as C by default, but the ability
to build the code as C++ assisted with catching at least a few bugs.
- Added a fix (or possibly more than one) for Catacomb 3-D crashes. Note
that the way this was done, a vanilla Catacomb 3-D rendering glitch is *not*
reproduced now. It may be possible with more efforts, although this obviously
depends on the original EXE's layout.
- As in the original DOS executables, there shouldn't be a noticeable fizzle
fade after loading a saved game in any of the Catacomb Adventure Series titles
(except for maybe the first time after starting the application).

Dec 20, 2014 (v0.9.12):

- Complete support for the Catacomb Adventure Series has been integrated.
In addition to version 1.13 of The Catacomb Abyss (Shareware release),
there is support for Abyss v1.24, Armageddon v1.02 and Apocalypse v1.01.
- It shall be noted that while it's possible to save and load games for The
Catacomb Armageddon/Apocalypse, most chances are they won't be compatible with
any of the original DOS executables. A new, hidden farptrsegoffset setting can
be added to the cfg file in order to make this somewhat more feasible, although
there's no guarantee it'll always work with the same value, given the structure
of the saved games (doesn't apply to Abyss).
- For another note, if the cheat code letting one cycle through ceiling/sky
colors is used while there is flashing (a lightning), this can lead to
so-called "undefined behaviors". It may look like there's no harm,
but a crash and/or other unexpected side-effects may occur.
- It turns out VSync was still enabled in the preceding release (v0.9.6) by
default for The Catacomb Abyss (and Catacomb 3-D), as well as Keen Dreams with
CGA graphics. Now, though, some adjustments were made in regards to timing, so
Skull 'n' Bones from Catacomb 3-D can be played back at a rate closer to the
original while VSync is toggled on, and not just while it's off. Furthermore,
VSync is again toggled on by default for all supported games, with the
exception of the CGA release of Keen Dreams (where it's off by default).

Nov 30, 2014 (v0.9.6):

- Support for Catacomb 3-D (The Descent) is now in. This includes support for
versions 1.00 and 1.22, as well as saved game compatibility with each of these
separately (although this can be buggy as usual). A lot of ID Engine code is
shared between the two, while an earlier revision of the ID Engine used by
Keen Dreams remains separate.
- Intro and exit screens are added for Catacomb Abyss. The intro can be skipped
by adding the /skipintro command line argument (same as launching vanilla
CATABYSS.EXE Shareware v1.13 with a seemingly-random pattern as an argument).
- Known non-vanilla bug/limitation: Skull 'n' Bones is a bit slower than
vanilla if VSync is toggled on (given a refresh rate of 60Hz), so it's disabled
by default in Catacomb 3-D for now. For the sake of consistency it's also
disabled in Catacomb Abyss. It is enabled in Keen Dreams by default if
EGA graphics are used, though.
- The Catacomb Abyss Vanilla bug reproduction: Numbers not shown in HUD on
startup immediately.
- A few more misc. changes.

Oct 25, 2014 (v0.9.0):

- RENAMING OF PORT: The Keen Dreams port has been renamed "Ref Keen Dreams".
This is done to be a just a little bit more original, and also follows the
addition of a new source port called "Ref Catacomb Abyss" (see next point).
Note that the source codes still have internal mentions of "CHOCO" or similar,
but from the user's point of view "Ref" is the new prefix for the two ports.
- Support for Catacomb Abyss (which shares a lot of code with Keen Dreams)
has been added. It is based on the original source code release from June 2014,
while modified to be compatible with the data from the Shareware release,
v1.13 (QA [0]).
- Apart from major modifications like ports of 3D scaling routines, there are
also some minor changes, like the support of a 640x200 graphics mode emulation
(for Catacomb Abyss help section, internally similar to 320x200) and overscan
borders flashing (technically supported since v0.8.10, but actually used now).
- There should be compatibility with saved games of the exact same Catacomb
Abyss release, but this can be buggy as usual. Furthermore, the way saved games
names are displayed in the corresponding dialogs (via the F3 or F4 key) may
seem a bit weird. This can be improved, but for now we have that.
- Another related complication is the fact that the Catacomb Abyss port is
compatible with a platform where case-sensitive filesystems are commonly used,
while under DOS this is not the case and filenames tend to be renamed uppercase
automatically. As of this version of the Catacomb Abyss port, newly saved
games' filenames are automatically converted to uppercase. The same applies
when typing a name for game loading (even if lowercase filenames are shown).
This shouldn't be a problem on case-insensitive filesystems, even if they're
case-preserving.
- Partial compatibility breakage: chocolate-keen-dreams.cfg is renamed
refkdreams.cfg. Similarly refcatabyss.cfg is used for Catacomb Abyss.

Oct 11, 2014 (v0.8.10):

- Fixed finale text printing (more generally, modified some functions
to better handle original code leading to undefined behaviors per the
C standard, or at least to crashes).
- Fixed King Boobus Tuber explosion.
- Added compatibility with the registered release, v1.93, and the Shareware
release, v1.20. Taking a look at the source codes release, they are both
almost identical to v1.13.
- Overscan borders are drawn now, even if permanently colored black (MM_SortMem
flashes the borders, but chances are the function is never called in practice).
- More miscellaneous fixes.

Oct 9, 2014 (v0.8.8):

- EGA graphics emulation has been added, and Chocolate Keen Dreams should be
compatible with the Shareware release of Keen Dreams, version 1.13.
- This includes compatibility with saved games (each Chocolate Keen exe should
be compatible with saved games of the corresponding release for DOS only).
- Two separate executables are used for the CGA and Shareware releases.
- chocolate-keen-dreams-cga.exe has been renamed to the shorter filename of
chocolate-kdreams-cga.exe. There's also chocolate-kdreams-shar.exe now.
- Difference from behaviors of vanilla Keen: For the Shareware release,
you don't need to select a "START" executable in order to launch the game.
But you can still get the message telling you need to type START by adding the
command-line argument of /detour (exact opposite of original behaviors).
- High scores table glitch is fixed.
- Other miscellaneous fixes.

Oct 3, 2014 (v0.8.2):

- Bilinear filtering can now be toggled on if hardware acceleration is in use.
- In case off-screen rendering is supported, it can be used for two-step
scaling of the graphical output: First nearest-neighbor interpolation with
the added "scalefactor" setting, and then bilinear.
- Sync to VBlank can be manually toggled now (if supported on the used setup).
By default "vsync=auto" is used, currently implying "off" (with CGA graphics).
- Live sound interpolation has been implemented, and it's possible to specify
a different sound sample rate, while the rate used for OPL emulation is still
49716Hz. Currently 49716 is the default value
- Fixed a bug: One cfg setting or more not written to file when it's expected.
- As of this version, the cfg file is (re)written on launch. This is done so
new settings can appear in the file if it's not up-to-date.

Sep 29 2014 (v0.8.1):

- Compatibility with saved games from vanilla Keen Dreams CGA v1.05 is in. As
expected, it can still be buggy (in fact, vanilla Keen also has its limits/bugs
with this).
- As a possibly indirect consequence, a vanilla Keen bug in
StateMachine/DoActor leading to a crash in Chocolate Keen Dreams
has been found (NULL pointer dereference). Workaround is applied now.
- The environment variables from last release are gone. Instead, you should
have the configuration file chocolate-keen-dreams.cfg to fiddle with (created
on launch if it doesn't exist).
- Custom fullscreen and windowed resolutions can be set in the configuration
file. Furthermore, aspect correction can be toggled off (e.g., in case screen
burn-in is a concern).
- Mouse cursor lock can be toggled off (from the cfg). By default the cursor is
now unlocked in a non-fullscreen window. Chances are the behaviors may still
feel a bit off, but at least we have that.
- Loading window with bars should display (while loading a map), although it's
shown for about a short moment on sufficiently fast machines.

Sep 26 2014 (v0.8.0):

- Initial release, based on Keen Dreams CGA v1.05. Should be playable with
sound effects and CGA graphics on Linux and Windows desktops. Game saving and
more is totally untested and may be incompatible with original data generated
by the corresponding DOS executable (saved games are known to be incompatible).
